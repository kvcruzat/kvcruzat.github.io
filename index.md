### [HTC Vive Virtual Reality Tech Demo](https://github.com/kvcruzat/vivedemo)
HTC Vive Virtual Reality Tech Demo: Developed a tech demo as a part of a group of two people that utilises the HTC Vive VR headset. The school of computing at the university had recently purchased VR kits and have been using it with off the shelf software for demos during open days. They required software developed by their own students to showcase technical skills developed during the course. A puzzle game was designed and developed using Unreal Engine 4. Terrain generation was created off engine by programming a random terrain generator that produces randomly generated graphs which acts as rivers then uses these to create a terrain around them. A reverse Towers of Hanoi logic was created for each intersection of rivers where the player must place discs to control the river flows so the vegetation surrounding the rivers receives the right amount of water.

### Finger Counting
System to count fingers being held up on images through a series of image analysis techniques. The hand is first segmented out of the background using colour segmentation using the k-means algorithm. After some cleaning of noise, the fingers are segmented from the hand using morphological operations. Thumbs are detected by calculating the gradients of the fingers and discarding any thumb-like anomalies. The remaining fingers are then counted to produce the result

### [Cloud Gaming and Simulation in Distributed Systems](https://github.com/kvcruzat/cloudgaming)
Reduced the latency within the networking in the cloud through Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Cloud gaming takes advantage of cloud technologies to offload processing away from the player and uses networking to send game inputs to the cloud and to send the frames as a result back to the player in the form of video data stream. SDN was used by deploying a dynamic load balancer application on to the network to deal with high network traffic which ultimately improved network latency so a player’s gameplay experience would be improved with this reduction of lag.

### [Crime-Eye (iOS)](https://github.com/kvcruzat/crime-eye)
Created an iOS app as part of a team within 3 weeks. With the help of the Police API, it assists the public in finding crime in a postcode, displaying the results on a map. The app also shows the user their local neighbourhood team and any associated contact details. External libraries used include: CocoaPods, Siesta Networking, SwiftyJSON, SwiftDate, ChameleonFramework, Charts, MMDrawerController

### Currency Converter Twitter Bot
Programmed a Twitter Bot that receives currency conversion requests in the form of tweets. It utilises SOAP web services to perform the currency conversion so the conversion rates are kept up to date. Twitter’s RESTful API is then used to send the results back to the user.

### Event Ticketing System (Android)
Developed an Android app that provides a system to track upcoming gigs and concerts and a method to purchase tickets for them. The system uses an Android front-end client which communicates to a remote server that handles network requests for database information. The main aim of the project was to experience using Agile techniques and to use real world software engineering techniques such as using Git for version control.

### BMI Calculator App (Android)
Developed an Android app that can calculate BMI with support for metric and imperial measurements and dynamically converts between them. Also, has camera functionality to share BMI results along with a picture to social networking services such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

### Against All Odds (Python, PyGame based game)
Successfully used the agile technique of pair programming to attain a first-class on a project to code a graphical game using the Pygame module with Python.
